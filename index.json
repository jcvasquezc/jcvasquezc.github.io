Those speech disorders have different origin depending on the type of the disease. For instance, diseases with morphological origin such as cleft lip and palate that causes hypernasality, or with neurodegenerative origin such as Parkinson’s disease that generates hypokinetic dysarthria on the patients. Automatic assessment of pathological speech allows to support the diagnosis and/or the evaluation of the disease severity. Conventional methods are based on the manually applied assessment of single features such as jitter, shimmer, or formant frequencies that may not completely model all of the phenomena that appear due to the disease. This paper introduces a novel strategy based on unsupervised representation learning for automatic detection of pathological speech. The proposed approach is based on the use of recurrent and convolutional autoencoders trained to extract informative features to characterize the presence of pathologies in speech. A novel feature set based on the reconstruction error of the autoencoders is also proposed. The performance of the introduced models is evaluated classifying pathological speech signals recorded from people suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and children with cleft lip and palate. All participants from this study were Spanish native speakers. The proposed models are accurate to classify the speech signals of both kinds of diseases, with an accuracy of up to 97% for cleft lip and palate, and up to 84% for the case of Parkinson’s disease. We also show that the reconstruction error from the autoencoders in different frequency regions contain information related to specific speech symptoms of both diseases.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care","Deep learning","representation learning"],"title":"Parallel Representation Learning for the Classification of Pathological Speech: Studies on Parkinson’s Disease and Cleft Lip and Palate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Kupfer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597069218,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597069218,"objectID":"91d7f6ae43842eaf25acddfcb484aec8","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/teaching/michael-kupfer/","publishdate":"2020-08-10T09:20:18-05:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/michael-kupfer/","section":"teaching","summary":"Bachelor in Computer science, Friedrich Alexander Universität (FAU), 2020.","tags":["Handwriting analysis","Machine learning","health-care"],"title":"Automated analysis of Parkinson’s Disease on the basis of evaluation of handwriting","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["T.

Speech recordings from 50 Spanish native speakers from Colombia (25 male) are considered for the experiments. The recordings include the utterance of the diadochokinesis task /pa-ta-ka/ which is typically used for the evaluation of motor speech disorders like those caused due to Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the diadochokinesis task allows us to train a system to detect the VOT of voiceless plosive sounds in intermediate positions. Acoustic analysis is performed by extracting different temporal and spectral features from the recordings. According to the results, it is possible to detect the VOT with F1-score values of 0.66 for Image 1, 0.75 for Image 2, and 0.78 for Image 3 when the predicted values are compared with respect to the manual VOT labels.","tags":["Speech processing","Deep learning","recurrent neural networks"],"title":"Automatic detection of Voice Onset Time in voiceless plosives using gated recurrent units","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"687834233f03727ae09c3a69b04b4f53","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/orozco-2020-current/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:01.3586Z","relpermalink":"/publication/orozco-2020-current/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter describes current methods and future trends in signal processing and pattern recognition techniques applied to the automatic analysis of motor impairments observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

In order to process this information, deep learning models with convolution layers can be used to obtain feature maps.

However, this may limit the potential of convolutional networks to learn different representations of the audio signal. In this paper, we propose a methodology to combine three different time–frequency representations of the signals by computing continuous wavelet transform, Mel-spectrograms, and Gammatone spectrograms and combining then into 3D-channel spectrograms to analyze speech in two different applications: (1) automatic detection of speech deficits in cochlear implant users and (2) phoneme class recognition to extract phone-attribute features.

One of the major manifestations of the disease appears in gait and typically causes disability in the most advanced stages of the disease. Gait assessment is suitable for the diagnosis and monitoring of the neurological state of the patients. Gait is mainly evaluated from signals collected with inertial sensors attached to the limbs, and kinematics features are commonly extracted. Besides the classical kinematic methods, there are nonlinear phenomena in the gait process that cannot be properly modeled with kinematic features. This study proposes the use of several nonlinear dynamics features to assess gait impairments of Parkinson’s patients. We consider classical nonlinear features including correlation dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, Hurst exponent, and others. In addition, we propose a novel nonlinear analysis based on the construction of Gaussian mixture models to find clusters in Poincaré sections. The nonlinear dynamics features proposed here are used to discriminate between Parkinson’s patients and healthy subjects, and to classify patients in different stages of the disease.

All these benefits also bring along multiple issues in terms of security and reliability in the evaluation the of student’s knowledge because traditional identity verification strategies, such as the combination of username and password, do not guarantee that the student enrolled in the course really takes the exam. Therefore, a system with a different type of verification strategy should be designed to differentiate valid users from impostors. This study proposes a new verification system based on distances computed among Gaussian Mixture Models created with different writing task. The proposed approach is evaluated in two different modalities namely intrusive verification and non-intrusive verification. The intrusive mode provides a false positive rate of around 16%, while the non-intrusive mode provides a false positive rate of 12% In addition, the proposed strategy for non-intrusive verification is compared to a work previously reported in the literature and the results show that our approach reduces the equal error rate in about 24.3%. The implemented strategy does not need additional hardware; only the computer keyboard is required to complete the user verification, which makes the system attractive, flexible, and practical for virtual education platforms.","tags":["Biometrics","Keystroke dynamics","Machine learning"],"title":"Identity Verification in Virtual Education Using Biometric Analysis Based on Keystroke Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan S Guerrero-Cristancho","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"38a9f293b4b928ad473a2058e583d2b6","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/guerrero-2020-word/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.789627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guerrero-2020-word/","section":"publication","summary":"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the language production and thinking capabilities of patients. The integrity of the brain is destroyed over time by interruptions in the interactions between neuron cells and associated cells required for normal brain functioning. AD comprises deterioration of the communicative skills, which is reflected in deficient speech that usually contains no coherent information, low density of ideas, and poor grammar. Additionally, patients exhibit difficulties to find appropriate words to structure sentences. Multiple ongoing studies aim to detect the disease considering the deterioration of language production in AD patients. Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to detect patterns that can be used to recognize the language impairments of patients. This paper covers advances in pattern recognition with the use of word-embedding and word-frequency features and a new approach with grammar features. We processed transcripts of 98 AD patients and 98 healthy controls in the Pitt Corpus of the Dementia-Bank database. A total of 1200 word-embedding features, 1408 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency features, and 8 grammar features were extracted from the selected transcripts. Three models are proposed based on the separate extraction of such feature sets, and a fourth model is based on an early fusion strategy of the proposed feature sets. All the models were optimized following a Leave-One-Out cross validation strategy. Accuracies of up to 81.7 % were achieved using the early fusion of the three feature sets. Furthermore, we found that, with a small set of grammar features, accuracy values of up to 72.8 % were obtained. The results show that such features are suitable to effectively classify AD patients and healthy controls.","tags":["Natural Language processing","Computational linguistics","health-care","Machine learning"],"title":"Word-Embeddings and Grammar Features to Detect Language Disorders in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"0645f8c603284b4079095d3c801e1687","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/orozco-2020-apkinson/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:01.3586Z","relpermalink":"/publication/orozco-2020-apkinson/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim: This paper introduces Apkinson, a mobile application for motor evaluation and monitoring of Parkinson’s disease patients.

PD dysarthria has often been the subject of feature selection and classification experiments, but rarely have the selected features been attempted to be matched to the pathophysiology of PD dysarthria. PD dysarthria manifests through changes in control of a person’s speech production muscles and affects respiration, articulation, resonance, and laryngeal properties, resulting in speech characteristics such as short phrases separated by pauses, reduced speed for non-repetitive syllables or supernormal speed of repetitive syllables, reduced resonance, irregular vowel generation, etc. Articulation, phonation, diadochokinesis (DDK) rhythm, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) features were extracted from the DDK and sustained /a/ recordings of the Spanish GITA Corpus. These recordings were captured from 50 healthy (HC) and 50 PD subjects. A two-stage filter-wrapper feature selection process was applied to reduce the number of features from 3,534 to 15. These 15 features mainly represent the instability of the voice and rhythm. SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes were used to test the discriminative power of the selected features.

The speech signals contain many traits that reflect suitable information from the speaker, including the identity, emotions, or the presence of diseases which alter the quality of life of patients. Automatic recognition of speech traits has many applications including the medical field; for instance, the detection, monitoring, and assessment of voice disorders allow the development of computer aided tools to support the diagnosis and evaluation/screening of patients; the recognition of emotions. Traditional machine learning methods to recognize speech traits are limited by their capability to process raw speech signals, i.e., without any preprocessing or any feature extraction. During several years, the deployment of suitable systems required the knowledge of an expert in a specific topic to obtain the most informative features to model the information from data, which consumes time and resources that are not always available. This project aims to develop and test different architectures of DNNs to perform the automatic detection of different traits in speech. Two different approaches will be addressed: (1) the raw speech signal will be considered as the input, and (2) several features will be extracted from the signals and those feature vectors will be the input of the system. We will compare both approaches in order to conclude to which extent it is possible to work only with the raw signal and obtain interpretable results such that can be used in the clinical practice. In this proposal, DNN-based methods will be considered to three different problems: (1) classification/detection of multiple voice disorders, (2) monitoring of patients, and (3) detection of emotions and other paralinguistic aspects from speech.\n","date":1565446350,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565446350,"objectID":"2c5823966e6be782aac910ea7e012795","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/project/deep-speech/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T09:12:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/deep-speech/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of architectures based on deep learning methods to evaluate and recognize traits in speech signals","tags":["Paralinguistics","Speech processing","Deep learning"],"title":"Deep Speech","type":"project"},{"authors":["GITA research group, University of Antioquia","COLCIENCIAS"],"categories":[],"content":"Human emotions detection considering speech signals is a field that has attracted the attention of the research community since the last years.

It generally deteriorates memory function, then language, then executive function to the point where simple activities of daily living (ADLs) become difficult. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, also primarily affecting individuals of advanced age. Its cardinal symptoms include akinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural imbalance. Together, AD and PD afflict approximately 55 million people, and there is no cure. Currently, professional or informal caregivers look after these individuals, either at home or in long-term care facilities. Caregiving is already a great, expensive burden on the system, but things will soon become far worse. Populations of many nations are aging rapidly and, with over 12% of people above the age of 65 having either AD or PD, incidence rates are set to triple over the next few decades. Monitoring and assessment are vital, but current models are unsustainable. Patients need to be monitored regularly (e.g. to check if medication needs to be updated), which is expensive, time-consuming, and especially difficult when travelling to the closest neurologist is unrealistic.

These groups face communication problems that can lead to social exclusion. They are now being further marginalised by a new wave of speech technology that is increasingly woven into everyday life but which is not robust to atypical speech. TAPAS is a Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Network European Training Network (MSCA-ITN-ETN) project that aims to transform the well being of these people. The TAPAS work programme targets three key research problems: (a)Detection: We will develop speech processing techniques for early detection of conditions that impact on speech production. The outcomes will be cheap and non-invasive diagnostic tools that provide early warning of the onset of progressive conditions such as Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s and Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s. (b)Therapy: We will use newly-emerging speech processing techniques to produce automated speech therapy tools. These tools will make therapy more accessible and more individually targeted. Better therapy can increase the chances of recovering intelligible speech after traumatic events such a stroke or oral surgery. (c)Assisted Living: We will re-design current speech technology so that it works well for people with speech impairments and also helps in making informed clinical choices. People with speech impairments often have other co-occurring conditions making them reliant on carers. Speech-driven tools for assisted-living are a way to allow such people to live more independently. TAPAS adopts an inter-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approach. The consortium includes clinical practitioners, academic researchers and industrial partners, with expertise spanning speech engineering, linguistics and clinical science.

Under the assumption that each phoneme sounds differently among clear and mask speech, the model is then used to compute frame-wise phonetic labels for the challenge data, including information about the presence of a surgical mask. These labels served to train a second phoneme recognition model which is finally able to differentiate between mask and clear phoneme productions. For a single utterance, we can compute a functional representation and learn a random forest classifier to detect whether a speech sample was produced with or without a mask. Our method performed better than the baseline methods on both validation and test set. Furthermore, we could show how wearing a mask influences the speech signal.

The current version of NeuroSpeech was developed to model dysarthric speech signals from people with Parkinson's disease; however, the structure of the software allows other computer scientists or developers to include other pathologies and/or other measures in order to complement the existing options. Three different tasks can be performed with the current version of the software: (1) the modeling of the speech recordings considering the aforementioned speech dimensions, (2) the automatic discrimination of Parkinson's vs. non-Parkinson's speech signals (if the user has access to recordings of other pathologies, he/she can re-train the system to perform the detection of other diseases), and (3) the prediction of the neurological state of the patient according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale is also provided (the user can also train the system to perform the prediction of other kind of scales or degrees of severity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first software with the characteristics described above, and we consider that it will help other researchers to contribute to the state-of-the-art in pathological speech assessment from different perspectives, e.g., from the clinical point of view for interpretation, and from the computer science point of view enabling the test of different measures and pattern recognition techniques.","tags":["Speech processing","Software","health-care","Python"],"title":"NeuroSpeech: An open-source software for Parkinson's speech analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcia-Ospina","Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Milos Cernak","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"bc92aa0da6380662407d391277523bb9","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2018-phonological/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.790341Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2018-phonological/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech disorders are common symptoms among Parkinson’s disease patients and affect the speech of patients in different aspects.

Additionally, the progression of those symptoms also differs among patients. Most of the studies on the analysis of speech of people with Parkinson’s disease do not consider such an individual variation. This paper presents a methodology for the automatic and individual monitoring of speech disorders developed by PD patients. The neurological state and dysarthria level of the patients are evaluated. The proposed system is based on individual speaker models which are created for each patient. Two different models are evaluated, the classical GMM–UBM and the i–vectors approach. These two methods are compared with respect to a baseline found with a traditional Support Vector Regressor. Different speech aspects (phonation, articulation, and prosody) are considered to model recordings of spontaneous speech and a read text. A multi-aspect coefficient is proposed with the aim of incorporating information from all of these speech aspects into a single measure. Two different scenarios are considered to assess a set with seven PD patients: (1) the longitudinal test set which consists of speech recordings captured in five recording sessions distributed from 2012 to 2016, and (2) the at-home test set which consists of speech recordings captured in the home of the same seven patients during 4 months (one day per month, four times per day). The UBM is trained with the recordings of 100 speakers (50 with Parkinson’s disease and 50 healthy speakers) captured with controlled acoustic conditions and a professional audio-setting. With the aim of evaluating the suitability of the proposed approaches and the possibility of extending this kind of systems to remotely assess the speech of the patients, a total of five different communication channels (sound-proof booth, Skype®, Hangouts®, mobile phone, and land-line) are considered to train and test the system. Due to the reduced number of recording sessions in the longitudinal test set, the experiments that involved this set are evaluated with the Pearson’s correlation. The experiments with the at-home test set are evaluated with the Spearman’s correlation. The results estimating the dysarthria level of the patients in the at-home test set indicate a correlation of 0.55 with a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale when the GMM-UBM model is applied upon the Skype® recordings. The results in the longitudinal test set indicate a correlation of 0.77 using a model based on i-vectors with recordings captured in the sound-proof-booth. The evaluation of the neurological state of the patients in the longitudinal test set shows correlations of up to 0.55 with the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale also using models based on i-vectors created with Skype® recordings. These results suggest that the i–vector approach is suitable when the acoustic conditions among recording sessions differ (longitudinal test set). The GMM-UBM approach seems to be more suitable when the acoustic conditions do not change a lot among recording sessions (at-home test set). Particularly, the best results were obtained with the Skype® calls, which can be explained due to several preprocessing stages that this codec applies to the audio signals. In general, the results suggest that the proposed approaches are suitable for tele-monitoring the dysarthria level and the neurological state of PD patients","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care","user-modeling","i-vectors"],"title":"Speaker models for monitoring Parkinson’s disease progression considering different communication channels and acoustic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Tobias Bocklet","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"88f859ee9aafa4d2837fc0c5b27cecaa","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.362902Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that produces motor and non-motor impairments. The evaluation of motor symptoms is currently performed following the third section of the Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III); however, only one item of that scale is related to speech impairments. It is necessary to develop a specific scale such that considers those aspects related to speech impairments of the patients.Aims: (i) To introduce and evaluate the suitability of a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (m-FDA) scale to quantify the dysarthria level of PD patients; (ii) to objectively model dysarthric speech signals considering four speech dimensions; (iii) to develop a methodology, based on speech processing and machine learning methods, to automatically quantify/predict the dysarthria level of patients with PD.Methods: The speech recordings are modeled using features extracted from several dimensions of speech: phonation, articulation, prosody, and intelligibility. The dysarthria level is quantified using linear and non-linear regression models. Speaker models based on i-vectors are also explored.Result and conclusion: The m-FDA scale was introduced to assess the dysarthria level of patients with PD. Articulation features extracted from continuous speech signals to create i-vectors were the most accurate to quantify the dysarthria level, with correlations of up to 0.69 between the predicted m-FDA scores and those assigned by the phoniatricians. When the dysarthria levels were estimated considering dedicated speech exercises such as rapid repetition of syllables (DDKs) and read texts, the correlations were 0.64 and 0.57, respectively. In addition, the combination of several feature sets and speech tasks improved the results, which validates the hypothesis about the contribution of information from different tasks and feature sets when assessing dysarthric speech signals. The speaker models seem to be promising to perform individual modeling for monitoring the dysarthria level of PD patients. The proposed approach may help clinicians to make more accurate and timely decisions about the evaluation and therapy associated to the dysarthria level of patients. The proposed approach is a great step towards unobtrusive/ecological evaluations of patients with dysarthric speech without the need of attending medical appointments.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care","user-modeling","i-vectors"],"title":"Towards an automatic evaluation of the dysarthria level of patients with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vasquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Philipp Klumpp","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5d3c1e9df918aa3d2b56678903e5d982","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.786491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's disease (PD) produces several speech impairments in the patients.

Specifically, impacted phonation and articulation causes the patient to have a breathy, husky-semiwhisper and hoarse voice. A goal of this paper is to characterise a VQ spectrum – the composition of non-modal phonations – of voice in PD. The paper relates non-modal healthy phonations: breathy, creaky, tense, falsetto and harsh, with disordered phonation in PD. First, statistics are learned to differentiate the modal and non-modal phonations. Statistics are computed using phonological posteriors, the probabilities of phonological features inferred from the speech signal using a deep learning approach. Second, statistics of disordered speech are learned from PD speech data comprising 50 patients and 50 healthy controls. Third, Euclidean distance is used to calculate similarity of non-modal and disordered statistics, and the inverse of the distances is used to obtain the composition of non-modal phonation in PD. Thus, pathological voice quality is characterised using healthy non-modal voice quality “base/eigenspace”. The obtained results are interpreted as the voice of an average patient with PD and can be characterised by the voice quality spectrum composed of 30% breathy voice, 23% creaky voice, 20% tense voice, 15% falsetto voice and 12% harsh voice. In addition, the proposed features were applied for prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay assessment score related to the larynx, and significant improvement is obtained for reading speech task. The proposed characterisation of VQ might also be applied to other kinds of pathological speech.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care","Computational linguistics"],"title":"Characterisation of voice quality of Parkinson’s disease using differential phonological posterior features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"35cd781242b4f849fceaa0746d5e05b6","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361025Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech impairments are one of the earliest manifestations in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

In this paper, the effects on the accuracy of five different methods to detect PD from speech are evaluated. Among the considered conditions, background noise produces the worst effect, while dynamic compression or some speech codecs can even have a marginal positive impact. We also consider, for the first time in this context, the problem of mismatches, i.e., when train/test acoustic conditions are different, and observe a high negative impact on all considered methods. Overall, this study is a step forward in performing a continuous monitoring of the neurological state of the patients in non-controlled acoustic conditions.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care"],"title":"Effect of acoustic conditions on algorithms to detect Parkinson's disease from speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcia","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Najim Dehak","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5c938d2f6d4017d1029c04ba7a976ae0","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2017-language/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.787039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2017-language/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech disorders are among the most common symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease. In recent years, several studies have aimed to analyze speech signals to detect and to monitor the progression of the disease. Most studies have analyzed speakers of a single language, even in that scenario the problem remains open. In this study, a cross-language experiment is performed to evaluate the motor impairments of the patients in three different languages: Czech, German and Spanish. The i-vector approach is used for the evaluation due to its capability to model speaker traits. The cosine distance between the i-vector of a test speaker and a reference i-vector that represents either healthy controls or patients is computed. This distance is used to perform two analyses: classification between patients and healthy speakers, and the prediction of the neurological state of the patients according to the MDS-UPDRS score. Classification accuracies of up to 72% and Spearman’s correlations of up to 0.41 are obtained between the cosine distance and the MDS-UPDRS score.

There is interest in the research community to study acoustic measures that provide objective information to model PD speech. Although there are several studies in the literature that consider different characteristics of Parkinson’s speech like phonation and articulation, there are no studies including the aging process as another possible source of impairments in speech. The aim of this work is to analyze the vowel articulation and phonation of Parkinson’s patients compared with respect to two groups of healthy people: (1) young speakers with ages ranging from 22 to 50 years and (2) people with ages matched with respect to the Parkinson’s patients. Each participant repeated the sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels three times and those utterances per speaker are modeled by using phonation and articulation features. Feature selection is applied to eliminate redundant information in the features space, and the automatic discrimination of the three groups of speakers is performed using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) following a one vs. all strategy, speaker independent. The results are compared to those obtained using a cognitive-inspired classifier which is based on neural networks (NN). The results indicate that the phonation and articulation capabilities of young speakers clearly differ from those exhibited by the elderly speakers (with and without PD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper introducing experimental evidence to support the fact that age matching is necessary to perform more accurate and robust evaluations of pathological speech signals, especially considering diseases suffered by elderly people, like Parkinson’s. Additionally, the comparison among groups of speakers at different ages is necessary in order to understand the natural change in speech due to the aging process.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","health-care"],"title":"Parkinson's disease and aging: analysis of their effect in phonation and articulation of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Jiménez-Monsalve","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Pedro Gomez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eca1ff7d1138cb7199d1491d294ce707","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.787436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","section":"publication","summary":"This study considers phonation and articulation measures to model voice disorders produced by three different pathologies: Laryngeal pathologies (LP), cleft lip and palate (CLP), and Parkinson’s disease (PD).

This research work aims in the development of a methodology for the automatic emotion recognition from speech signals in non-controlled noise conditions. For that purpose, different sets of acoustic, non-linear, and wavelet based features are used to characterize emotions in different databases created for such purpose. The acoustic analysis considers a standard feature set developed for emotion recognition from speech called OpenEAR, and a set of spectral and noise derived measures.  The non-linear analysis is based on non-linear dynamic measures and include the correlation dimension, the largest Lyapunov exponent, the Hurst exponent, and the Lempel Ziv complexity. Also it is proposed a set of measures derived from parametric non-stationary analysis using time dependent ARMA models. The wavelet based measures consider features derived from the wavelet packet transform, and different wavelet time-frequency representations such as the bionic wavelet transform, and the synchro-squeezed wavelet transform. Different non-controlled noise conditions are tested considering four different scenarios: (1) the original recordings, (2) the signals degraded by two additive noisy environments: street and a cafeteria babble, (3) the re-captured signals in two natural noisy environments asstreet and office, and (4) the recordings compressed by seven different codecs used for the transmission through mobile, VoIP, and web based telephone channels.

Some of the most relevant proposed applications of it are in call-centers. In these scenarios the speech is distorted by compression algorithms. The effects of such distortion on the performance of systems for automatic recognition of emotions must be assessed. In this study these effects are evaluated independently of any other distortions generated by the communications channel. Several state-of-the-art codecs are used to compress the speech signals of two emotional speech databases. The databases used are the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech and the enterface05. The methodology considers voiced and unvoiced segments of the speech separately. Spectral, cepstral, noise and Non-Linear Dynamics (NLD) measures are used to characterize the segments. Finally, a classifier based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to identify the emotion. The results indicate that voiced segments are less affected by the compression than unvoiced ones in terms in classification accuracy. They also show that the bandwidth of the analyzed signals is an important factor in the classification results.","tags":["Speech processing","Machine learning","non-linear dynamics","Emotion recognition","Paralinguistics"],"title":"Automatic emotion recognition in compressed speech using acoustic and non-linear features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"bcfe1a1d89bc5c95c3ec359e528dddb9","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.360692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic emotion recognition considering speech signals has attracted the attention of the research community in the last years. One of the main challenges is to find suitable features to represent the affective state of the speaker. In this paper, a new set of features derived from the wavelet packet transform is proposed to classify different negative emotions such as anger, fear, and disgust, and to differentiate between those negative emotions and neutral state, or positive emotions such as happiness. Different wavelet decompositions are considered both for voiced and unvoiced segments, in order to determine a frequency band where the emotions are concentrated. Several measures are calculated in the wavelet decomposed signals, including log-energy, entropy measures, mel frequency cepstral coefficients, and the Lempel-Ziv complexity. The experiments consider two different databases extensively used in emotion recognition: the Berlin emotional database, and the enterface05 database. Also, in order to approximate to real-world conditions in terms of the quality of recorded speech, such databases are degraded using different environmental noise such as cafeteria babble, and street noise. The addition of noise is performed considering several signal to noise ratio levels which range from -3 to 6 dB. Finally, the effect produced by two different speech enhancement methods is evaluated. According to results, the features calculated from the lower frequency wavelet decomposition coefficients are able to recognize the fear-type emotions in speech. Also, one of the speech enhancement algorithms has proven to be useful to improve of the accuracy in cases of speech signals affected by highly background noise.","tags":["Speech processing","Wavelets","Paralinguistics","Emotion recognition","Machine learning"],"title":"Emotion recognition from speech under environmental noise conditions using wavelet decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián D Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","LD Avendaño","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"0bbbba9fb117f660bc63f8cc01d2d238","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.788536Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","section":"publication","summary":"The speech signals are non-stationary processes with changes in time and frequency. The structure of a speech signal is also affected by the presence of several paralinguistics phenomena such as emotions, pathologies, cognitive impairments, among others. Non-stationarity can be modeled using several parametric techniques. A novel approach based on time dependent auto-regressive moving average (TARMA) is proposed here to model the non-stationarity of speech signals. The model is tested in the recognition of “fear-typeo” emotions in speech. The proposed approach is applied to model syllables and unvoiced segments extracted from recordings of the Berlin and enterface05 databases. The results indicate that TARMA models can be used for the automatic recognition of emotions in speech.","tags":["Speech processing","Paralinguistics","Emotion recognition","Machine learning"],"title":"Time dependent ARMA for automatic recognition of fear-type emotions in speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcı́a","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Jesus Francisco Várgas-Bonilla","Julian David Arias-Londono","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"6ed4a870302e1a425c3e627f0dd09699","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2014-evaluation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.791478Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2014-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"The estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) in speech is a very important task that has been addressed by many researchers. F0 estimation can be used to separate two kind of frames from an utterance, those where the vocal folds vibrate (voiced sounds) and those where not (unvoiced sounds). The methods used to estimate F0 are affected by the presence of additive noise in recordings made in non-controlled environments, however, there are different techniques to mitigate the effect of such noise and Speech Enhancement (SE) has proven to be one of the most effective ones. This article presents results of the evaluation of the effects of noise and SE algorithms on the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoiced segments. We performed experiments with signals artificially contaminated with two different kinds of noise, White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and background noise recorded at a cafeteria (Cafeteria babble), subsequently, the signals are processed with SE algorithms of four different classes: Wiener Filter, Spectral Subtraction, Statistical-Model Based and Sub-space algorithms. Two different kind of error metrics are considered: Gross Pitch Error and Voicing Determination Error. The results show that only the sub-space approach improves the performance in the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoicd segments.","tags":["Speech processing","Speech enhancement"],"title":"Evaluation of the effects of speech enhancement algorithms on the detection of fundamental frequency of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Olga Lucia Quintero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"c8962d3a43c09ade58ab6fdcd5fc7cb1","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361329Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"Detection of emotion in humans from speech signals is a recent research field. One of the scenarios where this field has been applied is in situations where the human integrity and security are at risk. In this paper we are propossing a set of features based on the Teager energy operator, and several entropy measures obtained from the decomposition signals from discrete wavelet transform to characterize different types of negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, disgust, and desperation. The features are measured in three different conditions: (1) the original speech signals, (2) the signals that are contaminated with noise, or are affected by the presence of a phone channel, and (3) the signals that are obtained after processing using an algorithm for Speech Enhancement based on Karhunen-Love Transform. According to the results, when the speech enhancement is applied, the detection of emotion in speech is increased in up to 22% compared to results obtained when the speech signal is highly contaminated with noise.","tags":["Speech processing","Wavelets","Paralinguistics","Emotion recognition","Machine learning"],"title":"Evaluation of wavelet measures on automatic detection of emotion in noisy and telephony speech signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"eac1987cf736406509a439a47d3e8d9c","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.357808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the coordination of muscles and limbs, including those responsible of the speech production. The lack of control ofthe limbs and muscles involved in the speech production process can generate intelligibility problems and this situation has a negative impact in the social interaction of the patients. It is already demonstrated that constant speech therapy can improve the communication abilities of the patients; however, the measurement of the recovery progress is done subjectively by speech therapists and neurologists. Due to this, it is required the development of flexible tools able to asses and guide the speech therapy of the patients. In this paper the design and deployment of a new device for the real time assessment of speech signals of people with PD is presented. The processes of design and deployment include the development on three platforms: first, a graphic user interface is developed on Matlab, second the first prototype is implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) and third, the final device is developed on a mini-computer. The device is equipped with an audio codec, storage capacity and the processing unit. Besides, the system is complemented with a monitor to display the processed information on real time and with a keyboard enabling the interaction of the end-user with the device. Different acoustics and nonlinear dynamics measures which have been used in the state of the art for the assessment of speech of people with PD are implemented on the three mentioned platforms. In accordance with the state of the art, the designed platforms show an increment in the variation of the fundamental period of speech (commonly called pitch) of people with PD. Additionally, the decrease of the vocal space area is validated for the case of patients with PD. These results indicate that the designed device is useful to perform the assessment and monitoring of the speech therapy of people with PD.","tags":["speech processing","health-care"],"title":"New computer aided device for real time analysis of speech of people with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["University of Antioquia","COLCIENCIAS"],"categories":[],"content":"Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Disease (PD) is the second neurological condition more prevalent after Alheimer.
